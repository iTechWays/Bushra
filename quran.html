                <p align="justify"> The holy Quran is the word of God. The Almighty revealed it to his final prophet and in turn to humanity. When prophets were inviting their people to the truth, God endowed them with miracles to convince their people. Moses was given a miracle that excelled magic and dazzled magicians in ancient Egypt. Jesus was given a miracle that excelled medicine as he could cure people from incurable diseases. The only people who could see these miracles are the ones who were there. As Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was the final prophet his miracle had to be continuous and immortal, this immortal miracle is the holy Quran itself.</p>
				
<p align="justify"> Here are some verses of the Quran that proof that The Quran is the word of ALLAH (GOD), as only ALLAH would have known at the time of revelation more than 1400 years ago, what scientist have discovered in recent times.</p>

			<p align="justify"><strong>“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation) before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe”. (Quran 21:30)</strong></p>
			<p align="justify">In the 1940s, George Gamow and Ralf Alefer (1948) proposed that the universe began in a colossal explosion. In 1949, the term given to the creation of the universe was “THE BIG BANG” and was coined by a Sir Fred Hoyle. The farther we look into space, the farther back in time we are seeing. Scientist only recently discovered that all galaxies are receding from each other which means at some point in the past they had to be closer together. At some point in the very distant past everything must have been together and this is what the Quran confirmed some 1400 Years ago.</p>

			<div class="col-md-8">
			
			<p align="justify"><strong>“He Who created the seven heavens in layers. You will not find any flaw in the creation of the All-Merciful. Look again-do you see any gaps? Then look again and again. Your sight will return to you dazzled and exhausted!” (Qur’an, 67:3-4)</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>“Do you not see how He created seven heavens in layers?” (Qur’an, 71:15)</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>“He to whom the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs. He does not have a son and He has no partner in the Kingdom. He created everything and determined it most exactly.” (Qur’an, 25:2)
</strong></p>
			<p align="justify">The term “fine-tuning,” which began to be used towards the end of the 20th century, represents this truth revealed in the verses. Over the last quarter-century or so, a great many scientists, intellectuals and writers have shown that the universe is not a collection of coincidences. On the contrary, it has an extraordinary design and order ideally suited to human life in its every detail. Many features in the universe clearly show that the universe has been specially designed to support life. In the 1960s, some physicists observed that our universe appears to have been fine-tuned for the existence of human life.</p>

			<p align="justify">Modern science tells us that the moon is moving around the Earth in an oval or elliptical orbit. Also the Earth and the rest of the planets, revolve in oval, or elliptical orbit around the sun.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>In the Quran this movement is described very eloquently:</strong></p>

			<p align="justify"><strong>“And he is the one who created the night, daylight, sun and the moon, all swimming in an orbit.” (Quran, the Prophets: 33).</strong></p>

			<p align="justify">The idea behind all of this is that if ALLAH is telling us: (All swimming in an orbit) that the natural mechanical movement of everything in the universe, whether it is radiation, dark matter, energy or solid masses, it is swimming, or what is known in physic as wavy motion.</p>

Then we produce every kind of fruit therewith. Similarly, we shall raise up the dead, so that you may remember or take heed.” (Quran (7:57) </strong></p>

			<p align="justify">Modern science has confirmed the scientific points mentioned in this verse of the Quran. The winds carry water particles which are rich in salt up into the atmosphere; these particles which are called ‘aerosols’ function as water traps and form cloud drops by collecting around the water vapor themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">The clouds are formed from water vapor that condenses around the salt crystals or dust particles in the air. As the water droplets in these clouds are very small, the clouds are suspended in the air, and spread across the sky, thus, the sky is covered in clouds. The water particles that surround salt crystals and dust particles thicken and form raindrops, so drops that become heavier than the air leave the clouds and start to fall to the ground as rain.

<p align="justify"><strong>“We created man from an extract of clay” (Quran 23:12) </strong></p>

			<p align="justify">When the human body is examined today, many elements present in the earth are also discovered to be found in the human body. Living tissues contain 95% carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur, with a total of 26 different elements.</p>
			
<p align="justify">The word “extract” in the verse means “representative example, essence.” As we have seen the information revealed in the Quran 1,400 years ago confirms what modern science tells us today that the same elements as those found in the soil /clay are employed in the creation of human.

			<p align="justify">Milk in cattle is synthesized through precise coordination between the digestive system, circulatory system and the reproductive system and then through the mammary glands in the udders and other organs, in exact calculated steps. Then Allah assigns every organ a function and specific duties before we finally have pure milk palatable for drink.</p>

			<p align="justify">It is worth noting that the amount of honey stored by bees is much greater than their actual need. So the first question that comes to mind is why do the bees not give up this “excess production”, which seems a waste of energy for them? The answer to this question is hidden in the “inspiration” stated in the verse to have been given to the bee. Bees produce honey not only for themselves but also for human beings. Bees, like many other natural beings, are also dedicated to the service of man.

			<div class="col-md-8">
		

			<p align="justify"><strong>“It is He who sends down water (rain) from the sky. With it we produce vegetation of all kinds from which (water or plants) we produce green substance out of which We produce grain in clusters. And out of date palms, from their spates come forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and (We produce) gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, each similar (in leaves or  shape), yet different (in fruit and taste). Look at (and think over) their fruits when they begin to bear fruit, and (look at) the ripeness thereof. Behold! In these things there are Signs for people who believe.” (Quran 6: 99)</strong></p>


			<p align="justify">This process of producing grain, fruits and trees was an unknown secret hidden deep in the thylakoids of the chloroplasts that cannot be seen with the naked eye and which were only discovered by botanists after prolonged research.

</p>
<p align="justify">Only after methods of precise scientific investigation were available that scientist of today confirm that in the plant there is a green substance and that it is this substance that produces carbohydrates that constitute the basic matter for producing all types of fruit, trees and vegetation. But yet the Qur’an confirmed these fourteen centuries ago and was conveyed by an illiterate Prophet who lived in a desert environment among an illiterate nation at a time when no equipment of scientific research was available.</p>

<p align="justify">The emphasis on fingerprints has a very special meaning. This is because shapes and details on everyone’s fingerprint are unique to each individual. Every person who is alive or who has ever lived in this world has a set of unique fingerprints. Furthermore, even identical twins having the very same DNA sequence have their own set of fingerprints.</p>
			<p align="justify"><strong>“Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.” (Qur’an, 75:4)</strong></p>


			<p align="justify">What is important is that this feature of fingerprints was only discovered in the late 19th century. Before then, people regarded fingerprints as ordinary curves without any specific importance or meaning. However in the Qur’an, Allah points to the fingertips, which did not attract anyone’s attention at that time, and calls our attention to their importance. This importance has only been fully understood in our day.

<p align="justify"><strong> “Have We not made the earth as a bed and the mountains its pegs” (Qur’an, 78:6-7)</strong></p>

			<p align="justify">The two verses state that mountains perform the function of preventing shocks in the Earth. This fact was not known by anyone at the time the Qur’an was revealed. It was, in fact, brought to light only recently, as a result of the findings of modern geological research. Formerly, it was thought that mountains were merely protrusions rising above the surface of the Earth. However, scientists realized that this was not actually the case, and that those parts known as the mountain root extended down as far as 10-15 times their own height. With these features, mountains play a similar role to a nail or peg firmly holding down a tent. For example, Mount Everest, the summit of which stands approximately 9 km above the surface of the Earth, has a root deeper than 125 km.24

The Kingdom is His. Those you call on besides Him have no power over even the smallest speck.” (Quran:Surah Fatir, 13)</strong></p>

			<p align="justify">The Sun has been emitting heat for around 5 billion years as a result of the constant chemical reactions taking place on its surface. At a moment determined by Allah in the future, these reactions will eventually come to an end, and the Sun will lose all its energy and finally go out. In that context, the above verses may be a reference to the Sun’s energy one day coming to an end. Scientists have only recently unraveled the structure of the Sun and discovered what goes on inside it and now agree that the Sun will come to an end. Before that, nobody knew how the Sun obtained its energy or how it emitted heat and light. The way that such a giant mass of energy would one day consume all its energy and expire was revealed 1400 years ago in the Qur’an shows the presence of a sublime knowledge. That knowledge belongs to our Lord, Whose knowledge enfolds all things.

			<div class="col-md-8">
		

			<p align="justify"><strong> “And We also sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind…” (Qur’an, 57:25)</strong></p>

			<p align="justify">This verse implies a very significant scientific miracle. Because, modern astronomical findings have disclosed that the iron found in our world has come from giant stars in outer space.
Not only the iron on earth, but also the iron in the entire Solar System, comes from outer space, since the temperature in the Sun is inadequate for the formation of iron. The sun has a surface temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius, and a core temperature of approximately 20 million degrees. Iron can only be produced in much larger stars than the Sun, where the temperature reaches a few hundred million degrees. When the amount of iron exceeds a certain level in a star, the star can no longer accommodate it, and it eventually explodes in what is called a “nova” or a “supernova.” These explosions make it possible for iron to be given off into space.

			<p align="justify"><strong> “I swear by the fig and the olive.”(Qur’an, 95:1)</strong></p>

			<p align="justify">As we have seen, a great many scientists today think that an olive oil-based diet constitutes the ideal nutritional model. It is stated that on account of these properties, olives and olive oil should be the fundamental constituents of every meal in one’s daily nutrition programme. The benefits of the olive plant, emphasized by Allah in many verses of the Qur’an, have been discovered in parallel to the advances made by medical science.


</p>
<p align="justify">Figs have a higher fiber level than any other fruit or vegetable. One single dried fig provides two grams of fiber: 20% of the daily recommended intake. Research over the last fifteen years or so has revealed that the fiber in plant foods is very important for the regular functioning of the digestive system. Despite being one of the oldest fruits known to man, the fig-described as “nature’s most nearly perfect fruit” by the California Fig Advisory Board has been rediscovered by food producers. The nutritional value of this fruit and its health benefits have led to its acquiring a whole new importance. From the point of view of human health, the nutritional value of the fig and olives was only established with the advance of medicine and technology. This is another indication that the Qur’an is indisputably the Word of Allah, the Omniscient.</p>

			<p align="justify">It has only been possible to reveal the health benefits of fish by a great many scientists working in well-equipped research laboratories. The fact that such a valuable source of nutrition is indicated in the Qur’an, and especially that it is described as a fatigue eliminator in Surat al-Kahf, is nothing short of awe-inspiring. All the benefits provided by fish are a great blessing given us by our Lord. As with all foods, it is Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, Who has created the superior structure in fish for our benefit.

			<div class="col-md-8">
		

			<p align="justify"><strong>  “And [I swear] by the night when it draws in, and by the dawn when it breathes in.” (Qur’an, 81:17-18)</strong></p>
	<p align="justify"><strong> “Anything you catch in the sea is lawful for you and all food from it, for your enjoyment and that of travelers…”(Qur’an, 5:96)</strong></p>
			<p align="justify">The productivity of photosynthesis is measured by the level of oxygen output. The greatest point is in the morning, when the Sun’s rays are most concentrated. At dawn, the leaves begin to sweat and photosynthesis increases accordingly. In the afternoon, however, the opposite applies; in other words photosynthesis slows down, and respiration increases because as the temperature rises perspiration also increases. At night, as the temperature falls, perspiration declines and the plant rests.</p>
<p align="justify">The term “when it breathes in” particularly emphasizes the way that the production of oxygen begins in the morning, and that the greatest levels of oxygen, essential for respiration, are given off at that time. The importance of the phenomena is also emphasized by the way that Allah swears upon it. The way that Allah indicates the action of photosynthesis, among the most important discoveries of the 20th century, in this verse, is another of the scientific miracles of the Qur’an.</p>

	<p align="justify"><strong> “He has let loose the two seas, converging together, with a barrier between them they do not break through.”(Qur’an, 55:19-20)</strong></p>
			<p align="justify">This property of the seas, that is, that they meet and yet do not intermix, has only very recently been discovered by oceanographers. Because of the physical force called “surface tension,” the waters of neighboring seas do not mix. Caused by the difference in the density of their waters, surface tension prevents them from mingling with one another, just as if a thin wall were between them.</p>
			
<p align="justify">It is interesting that, during a period when there was little knowledge of physics, and of surface tension, or oceanography, this truth was revealed in the Qur’an.</p>

			<p align="justify">Indeed, the astronauts’ spacecraft pass through each layer of the atmosphere one by one, and then begin to pass through the Moon’s gravitational field. Thus, the Moon is reached by moving through individual layers. In addition, the swearing by the Moon by ALLAH, further strengthens this emphasis, meaning that the verse may well be a sign that humanity will travel to the Moon.</p>
			
<p align="justify">These are just some of the many hundreds of verses in the Quran which are simply inspirational and divine. In order to appreciate the scientific miracles contained in the Qur’an, we must understand the level of scientific knowledge which existed at the time when this holy book was revealed. When one understands the context in which the Qur’an was revealed, one can understand more clearly how extraordinary the book of Islam actually is.</p>
